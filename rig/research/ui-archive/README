The first iteration of Rig included an editor that depended on these 2D widgets.

The aim now is to avoid having a 2D widget architecture that doesn't build on top of Rig's entity, component model or build on the same rendering engine used by Rig based applications.

Instead of removing these completely they are preserved here until they can be adapted into components.
