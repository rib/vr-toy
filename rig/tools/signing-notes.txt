Generate the public/private key pair with this command:

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out rig-key.pem -des3

Pick a password to encrypt the private key with.

Extract the public key with this command:

openssl rsa -in rig-key.pem -pubout -out rig-key-pub.pem

Sign the data file with the following command:

openssl sha256 -binary < rig-release.tgz | \
  openssl pkeyutl -sign \
          -out rig-sig \
          -inkey rig-key.pem \
          -pkeyopt digest:sha256

Prefix the signed result to the distribution using cat:

cat rig-sig rig-release.tgz > rig-release.tgz.signed
