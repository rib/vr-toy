Download and unpack the latest android SDK
Download and unpack ndk r10b

Follow the NDK docs on building a standalone toolchain, E.g.:

build/tools/make-standalone-toolchain.sh --platform=android-18 --install-dir=$HOME/local/android-toolchain

Edit the build-android-modules-arm-bashrc file in this directory to
point to the locations for the Android SDK and NDK.

Source the bashrc file into your shell. (Further notes assume they can
refer to these variables.)

source build-android-modules-arm-bashrc

Build the modules:

./build-android-modules.sh

Build Rig itself:

cd ../android/project

android list targets

Then run:

android update project -p . -t <TARGET_ID>

NDK_DEBUG=1 ndk-build

Then build an apk using:

ant debug

Connect to a device via a usb cable

Install the apk:
$ adb install bin/RigSlave-debug.apk

Get a shell on the device and run the test:
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.MAIN -n org.rig.app.RigSlave/android.app.NativeActivity

ndk-gdb
NB: you may need to switch thread once connected via gdb

To rebuild and re-install do something like:
rm -fr bin libs obj && NDK_DEBUG=1 ndk-build -B && ant debug && adb install -r bin/RigSlave-debug.apk

It shouldn't be necessary to scrap everything for each re-build but
I've been finding that the tools don't always notice when things have
changed and don't rebuild things when you want them too. For now I've
resorted to scrapping everthing each re-build just to be sure.
