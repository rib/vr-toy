Before building this example you need to symlink a copy of the SDL
source under the jni/ directory:

$ cd jni/
$ ln -s /path/to/sdl-source SDL

You may need to update the project for your target:

$ android list target
$ android update project -p . -t android-15

Build the example by running:

$ ndk-build

Or a debug build with:

$ ndk-build NDK_BUILD=1

Package the example by running:

$ ant debug

Install the example to a device with:

$ ant debug install
